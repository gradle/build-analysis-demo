== Gradle Build Analysis Project

The purpose of this project is to provide data for developer productivity by collecting and reporting:
 * Costliest Gradle tasks
 * Flaky Tests
 * Most common build errors

This is separate from the CI Health project because it deals more directly with local development infrastructure.

A project separate from the dotcom/export-api-app was needed to allow this to be presentable for users and to provide real-world feedback on the GE export API.
